# My First Flask Server

This Flask application was made as a learning opportunity,  
and came to replace an existing Node.js server for one of my projects -  
The Dark-web Scraper featured on my profile here in github.

It is not that complex or gigantic, but trying to get it right,  
I encountered many difficulties in the differences between JS and Python, and managed to move past them.

Here's a link to the Scraper project repository - https://github.com/KanerA/Dark-web-Scraper.

## Instructions

If you'd like to run the Dark-web scraper with this server,  
fork both of the repositories.

Go to the main project's directory, and then to client/src/SetupProxy.js,  
comment out the line of `localhost:8081` , and uncomment the `localhost:5000`.

After you've done that, follow the steps in the main project's readme file, except the server's, for that, use the command flask run on this project, after setting up a virtual environment for python.
